    <h4>New School Canteen</h4>
    <img src="canteen.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7">A school canteen is a facility that provides meals to students and can also be a place to promote nutrition and sustainability. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, a cafeteria is sometimes called a canteen. 
      Here are some things to consider about school food canteens: 
      Size
      The standard length of a school canteen is 160â€“180 cm, and the standard size per child is 60 cm.
      Food
      Some healthy snack options include fresh fruit, carrot sticks, and low-fat milk. Some popular drinks include water, juice, milk, and soda. Lunch items can include sandwiches, wraps, salads, and hot foods like pizza or pasta.
      Promotions
      To boost canteen sales, you can keep the food service area, food display areas, and equipment clean and tidy. You can also create a welcoming environment by keeping the area and furniture around the canteen clean, tidy, and inviting. You can also ask classes or student groups to help decorate the canteen area with art works, posters, and signs.
      Convenience
      School lunches are often served in a cafeteria setting, which can be a convenient way for children to get a healthy meal during the school day. This is particularly important for children who may not have access to healthy food options at home.</p>

  <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
  <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Attendance tracking systems
    These can be electronic or paper-based. Some attendance tracking systems can also use biometric devices, like fingerprint or iris scanners.
    School attendance platforms
    These can track attendance, tardiness, and absences. They can also generate reports, send reminders, and monitor trends.
    Calling roll
    This is one of the easiest ways to take attendance, even in large classes. You can also call roll for students attending via Zoom.
    Attendance sheets
    Teachers can hand out attendance sheets and have students sign their names. Some teachers write down the data in a notebook, while others use an Excel sheet.
    Apps
    Some apps can help track attendance, including:
    Tracking attendance can help schools identify students who are frequently absent. This allows schools to intervene before attendance problems become chronic. Early intervention can help prevent absenteeism, keep students on track, and improve their academic performance.
